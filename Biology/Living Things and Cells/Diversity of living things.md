Biodiversity means a range of living things.

There is great biodiversity on Earth, and every organism needs special conditions to thrive.
Unfortunately, many habitats are being lost due to human activities, such as:

- Building housing and roads.
- Increased demand for building supplies.
- Waters being polluted.
